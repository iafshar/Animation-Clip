# Animation-Player
Animation player that takes in a .skel, .skin, and .anim file and presents a multi-jointed character in motion

The .skel file will provide information to the player about the character's joints.
The .skin file will provide information to the player about the skin mesh of the character that will be wrapped around the joints.
The .anim file will provide information to the player about how the character should move.

Usage:
/menv file1.skel file2.skin file3.anim

Example files (wasp.skel, wasp.skin, wasp_walk.anim) are provided that give you a looped animation clip of a wasp walking.
